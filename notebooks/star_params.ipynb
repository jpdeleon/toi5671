    "* We derived the radii using Stefan–Boltzmann’s law. \n",
    "* We obtained the required effective temperatures Teff from a spectral analysis and we obtained the required luminosities L from integrated broadband photometry together with the Gaia DR2 parallaxes.\n",
    "* The mass was then determined using a mass-radius relation that we derived from eclipsing binaries known in the literature.\n",
    "* We compared this method with three other methods: (1) We calculated the mass from the radius and the surface gravity log g, which was obtained from the same spectral analysis as Teff. (2) We used a widely used infrared mass-magnitude relation. (3) We used a Bayesian approach to infer stellar parameters from the comparison of the absolute magnitudes and colors of our targets with evolutionary models."

    "The stellar metallicity is estimatedas[Fe/H] = 0.30±0.15using WISE and Gaia colors3(Equation 4 from Duque-Arribas et al. 2023). This pho-tometric relationship was determined by Duque-Arribaset al. (2023) to be the most accurate photometric cali-bration when compared to a well-characterized (i) spec-troscopic sample of M-dwarfs (Birky et al. 2020) and (ii)M-dwarfs in binary systems (Montes et al. 2018). Thestellar radius is calculated asR⋆= 0.62±0.02R⊙us-ing Equation 5 from Mann et al. (2015).  This valuewas then used to determine a mass ofM⋆= 0.63±0.02M⊙with Equation 6 from Schweitzer et al. (2019), whichalso agrees with the stellar mass estimate from Mannet al. (2019).  The stellar effective temperature is de-rived as3920±50K with the empirical calibration fromEquation 7 in Rabus et al. (2019), that was derivedusing interferometric observations of well-characterizedM-dwarfs. "
